# Freight-Management-API
Can modify (add/delete) and check for specific freight information based on input details.
This is a logistics based API created using Java Spring Boot framework which implements different functionalities like GET (to get list of loads with a particular ID), PUT (update load details for a particular load, identified by the load id), POST (add a new load to the existing list of loads) and DELETE (to delete a load with a particular ID as parameter).
I created this with the vision of helping users automate the processes of freight transportation, with much less hassle than it involves in the whole process, currently.
Some screenshots demonstrating the working of CRUD operations are given below:-
